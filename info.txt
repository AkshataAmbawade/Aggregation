Q.Why do we use aggregation pipeline?
=>The basic find() function of mongoDb is not that sufficient to do documents query. It is a multi stage pipeline where processing happens on each and every stage and each stage's output pass to the next stage 

There are three ways to perform aggregation in MongoDB:
-the map-reduce function
-single-purpuse aggregation
-the aggregation pipeline

Each stage takes documents as a input and perform operations on it and returns documents as a output





properties : (stageOperator)

1.$match : it is used to filter documents by certain query
2.$group: Group documents by certain criteria .Basically it's use for grouping of a documents
3.$sort: sort objects in acending and descending
4.$sum
5.$add
6.$count : counts the nubers of the documents
7.$limit :Limits numbers of the documents
8.$skip : skip the amount of the documents
9.$addtofield
10.$output
11.$out : writes the result of the aggregation in another collection
12.$merge
13.$cond
14.$lookup
15.$unwind
16.$project: filters the fields in the documents
17.$arrayElementAt
18.$reverseArray
19.$sortArray
20.$push



Aggregation Expression
-Eexpression refers to the name of the field input documents
"$<fieldName>"

aggregation Expression is nothing but the values from  key and value pairs
aggregation Expression should always be in double quotes otherwise it will be consider as variable
